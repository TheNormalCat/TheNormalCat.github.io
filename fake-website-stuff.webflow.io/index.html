This adds the fruit to a list of dangerous fruits that if consumed wrong can cause serious health side effects, including death. Food Scientist Carlo Hurley was looking closer into the makeup of a banana, when he noticed something strange. After a few more tests, the suspicion was confirmed. </div><blockquote class="block-quote">&quot;I was just finishing up a day at ███████ research facility, when I saw a banana just sitting on the desk. No one was around and I had always wanted to know what these fruits actually were, so I just did some looking into it. I discovered the Hydrogen Cyanide around 10 minutes into the tests, and quickly rushed to tell someone about it. There really isn&#x27;t anything to worry about though, as the amounts contained in an average banana are so little, that an average adult would have to eat around 400 banana stems, and who even eats the stems anyway?&quot;</blockquote><div class="text-block-2">Not much information has been released about this topic, only some twitter posts and the clip of Carlos Hurley saying the exact words above.</div><script src="../d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8f6be.js?site=617efed5b292f8bd189b5048" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="../uploads-ssl.webflow.com/617efed5b292f8bd189b5048/js/webflow.8cd5b170b.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body>
